# Sorting Visualizer

this project is an interactive 3D model of Rubik's Cube.

I have bootstrapped this project with CRA's typescript template and have used the following packages:

| Package                  | Usage                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Typescript + React       | Used as the engine via which the application is rendered     |
| ThreeJS                  | Used for rendering the 3D model of the Cube and interactions |
| React Router + History@5 | Used for the routing of the application                      |
| SCSS                     | Used for styling the application                             |
